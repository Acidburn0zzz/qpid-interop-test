Writing shims for new clients
-----------------------------
A detailed description of this process is (will be) contained in the docs
directory. The very short version of this is as follows:

1. Write a pair of client programs using the client API under test.

The first is a sender which reads the following from the command-line:

<broker address> <amqp type> <test value 1> <test value 2> ...

and is responsible for sending messages containing the test values each in a
single message in the appropriate AMQP type format.

The second client program is a receiver, and must read the following from the
command-line

<broker address> <amqp type> <num messages>

and is responsible for receiving <num messages> messages from the broker and
printing the bodies of the received messages appropriately decoded for type
<amqp type>. The printed output will contain the amqp type on the first line
and each received message body on subsequent lines, one message per line.

2. Add a subclass for this client in
src/py/qpid-interop-test/types/simple_type_test.py
derived from class Shim and which overrides NAME, ENV (as needed), SHIM_LOC,
SEND and RECEIVE. SEND and RECEIVE must point to the two clients written
in step 1 above.

3. Add an instance of your new shim class to SHIM_MAP keyed against its name.

That's it!
